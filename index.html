<h1>Assassins</h1>

<p>This is the webpage for the game of Assassins starting on Monday, March 31st at 8:00am at UofT.</p>

<p>When people die they will be listed here.</p>

<p>➡ So and so died a tragic death by the largest strike of lightning ever seen in history. </p>


<h4>When you die, please report it to me (valentinalf on Discord or at vlinfang@gmail.com).</h4>

<p>Remember, most of this is on the honor system, so please be honest to keep the game fun.</p>

<p>Also, the game is assassins, please no teamwork!</p>

<h2>Assassins Rules</h2>

<h3>1.0 General Rules:</h3>

<p>a. Everyone gets one target to “kill” from the pool of players.</p>

<p>b. You can kill your target only.</p>

<p>c. For a kill to register, you must hit your target with a valid weapon in the target area for that weapon and provide proof that this person is your target.</p>

<p>d. Kills may not be made in safe areas.</p>

<p>e. The game continues until one assassin remains.</p>

<p>f. When you are killed, you are out of the game.</p>

<p>g. The game does not stop until it is over.</p>

<p>h. Do not tell anyone who your target is.</p>

<p>i. When you kill a target, you get their target.</p>

<p>j. You may use non players for information only. You may not have non players spy for you and you may not tell them about the game. You may only ask for information or have them interact with the target for means of distraction as long as they do not know that you are playing the game.</p>

<h3>2.0 Weapons Rules:</h3>

<h4>2.1 Guns</h4>

<p>➡ Water guns and syringes are allowed. These are the only types of guns allowed. They are allowed outside as long as the target is not carrying sensitive material (papers, books, etc.).</p>

<p>➡ To kill with a water gun, you must hit the target anywhere. You may fire as many times as you wish, however, if the target catches you firing or about to fire, and they are not hit, then the attack fails.</p>

<h4>2.2 Knives</h4>

<p>➡ Plastic spoons are the only knives allowed. </p>

<p>➡ To make a kill with a spoon, you must make a hit above the waist and between the shoulders (head, neck, and torso). The scoop end is the deadly end. </p>

<p>➡ If you hit in a non lethal area, or you miss an attack and are spotted, blocked, or hit with a counterattack, the attack fails.</p>

<h4>2.3 Grenades</h4>

<p>➡ Water balloons are allowed outside as long as the target is not carrying sensitive material (papers, books, etc.). The water balloon must hit the person and explode.</p>

<p>➡ Rolled up socks are allowed.</p>

<p>➡ To kill with a grenade, you must throw and hit the target anywhere on a fly.</p>

<p>➡ You may not pick up a missed thrown sock and throw again. If you are spotted, you still may throw another sock.</p>

<h4>2.4 Poison</h4>

<p>➡ You may poison someone’s food with ketchup or chocolate sauce.</p>

<p>➡ If you have been poisoned, you have 5 minutes to procure an antidote.</p>

<p>➡ An antidote is a French fry or potato chip from someone you do not know. </p>

<p>➡ An antidote, when taken, protects the target for the entire meal.</p>

<p>➡ A poison attempt which has been neutralized by antidote, or is spotted before the target eats it, is considered a failed attack.</p>

<h4>2.5 Bombs</h4>

<p>➡ A bomb is when the assassin sets off the targets alarm clock at a different time than the target usually sets it. The time must be different from the current time by at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>➡ If a bomb goes off and the target is in the room, regardless of what they are doing, they are dead.</p>

<p>➡ Remember, if you set off a bomb you must be waiting nearby and ready to present proof of target.</p>

<p>➡ The assassin cannot be in the room when their bomb goes off. If they are, it is considered a failed attack.</p>

<p>➡ If the target checks their alarm and detects a bomb and fixes it, then the bomb is defused and considered a failed attack.</p>

<p>➡ Bombs that will trigger at night (after 11pm) cannot occur.</p>

<h4>2.6 Easiest Way: Stickers</h4>

<p>➡ To assassinate someone, place a sticker (with the victim's name written on the inside) on somebody undetected for 2 minutes straight. It must be a TrackOne sticker (please please please Jim).</p>

<p>➡ At any time if the victim notices the sticker and removes it, the attack fails</p>

<h4>2.7 Other weapons</h4>

<p>➡ If you have any other suggestions of friendly weapons or methods of assassination, you may email Valentina with the email headline of: "Approval requested for new method: [Name of method goes here]". She will try her very best to approve within 12 hours.</p>


<h3>3.0 Safety Zones:</h3>

<p>The safety zones are:</p>

<p>➡ Any and all classes. Once a target enters a classroom, they are safe. If they are on their way to a class which is already underway (late), they are safe.</p>

<p>➡ Any Libraries </p>

<p>➡ Places of Work: Labs, Offices, etc </p>

<p>➡ Any and all Dorm Rooms (except for setting bombs).</p>

<p>➡ Any important meetings.</p>

<p>➡ Bathrooms</p>

<p>➡ Places of worship </p>

<p>➡ The Pit between the hours of 9am to 6pm </p>

<p>➡ No setting bombs to go off after midnight on weekdays.

<p>➡ No attacking during important study groups or sleep.

<p>A failed attack means that the assassin must cease attacking and stop stalking the target for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>No attacking a person on their way to a test (i.e. book in face).</p>
