# assassins-the-game

welcome all to my long-awaited game of assassin at our university!!!

my longing for this project has been over a year (cough cough trying to make a discord bot unsuccessfully), and i finally decided to just go for the first round! no fancy automation or ai or technology, just a good old website for the game rules and updates. 

may you become the greatest assassin!

details of game 1:
- location: our beloved university
- time: from monday, march 31st, when you pick up your "weapon" to friday at 4pm
- players: you!!!
